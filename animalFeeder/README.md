# animal_feeder
In this project you are adding loops to the feedTest.test.ts using the animal.ts and the zoo.ts
Each of the pages that you have access to have breakdowns of what each one is doing and instructions where they are needed. 
You are editing the feedTest file only. 
Solution can be found in the solution folder feel free to use it if that is how you learn/process better! 
Good luck and have fun!
